# About

Have you felt down and in need of encouragement lately? In a world with so much stress and negativity, we at FreshlyMinted feel it is time to spread some good vibes on the blockchain. Let us introduce you to EncourageMINTs!

Thousands of EncourageMINT NFTs have been waiting in anticipation to serve their purpose as messengers of compliMINTs and uplifting meMINTos for all those embarking on their minting journeys. The release date is TBD, but look forward to becoming a Friend of an EncourageMINT (or perhaps a special rare Candy) soon!

Upon minting your mint, you will get access to an exclusive T-shirt with your NFT on it. EncourageMINTs also make great gifts, and holders will receive special advantages as early investors in FreshlyMinted. Besides access to exclusive Discord channels and giveaways, Friends will receive an airdrop of future FreshlyMinted NFT projects, which will be collaborations with popular brands, influencers, and artists around the globe.

Additionally, 30% of the sale proceeds will go directly to charity. FreshlyMinted has chosen to support [Polaris Project](https://polarisproject.org/crypto/) in their fight against human trafficking.

We look forward to welcoming our Friends into an uplifting community where we can help one another grow in the NFT space!
